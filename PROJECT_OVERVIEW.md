## üöÄ **Development Approach**

### **User Preferences**
- **iOS-first** approach is critical
- **UI should be extremely minimal, super simple, and elegant**
- **Prefer thorough inline comments and documentation**
- **Don't start Xcode simulator automatically** - user will run it
- **Commits only after finishing main tasks, not sub-tasks**

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Comprehensive error handling** throughout the application
- **Performance-focused** implementation with measurable targets
- **Accessibility compliance** with VoiceOver support
- **iOS consistency** following Apple's guidelines
- **Offline-first architecture** with Core Data + Firebase Firestore

### **SwiftUI Best Practices**
- **MVVM architecture** with proper separation of concerns
- **ObservableObject** for state management
- **NavigationStack** for modern iOS navigation
- **Core Data** for persistence and sync
- **SwiftUI previews** for rapid development

## üìã **Project Scope Summary**

**Total Tasks:** 23 comprehensive tasks covering the full application lifecycle (iOS + macOS)
**Current Progress:** 1/23 tasks complete (4%)
**Next Priority:** Task 2 - Three-Color Design System and Typography

### **Logical Development Roadmap:**

#### **Phase 1: Foundation** üèóÔ∏è (iOS First)
1. **Task 1:** Setup SwiftUI Project with Core Data and CloudKit Integration
2. **Task 2:** Implement Three-Color Design System and Typography  
3. **Task 3:** Build Core Data Models with Relationships

#### **Phase 2: Core Functionality** ‚ö° (iOS Core)
4. **Task 6:** Build Individual Note Editor with Live Markdown *(FIRST - you need to be able to create/edit notes)*
5. **Task 4:** Create Notes List Screen with Performance Optimization *(SECOND - you need notes to display in the list)*

#### **üñ•Ô∏è NEW PHASE: macOS Foundation** üñ•Ô∏è (Cross-Platform Extension)
6. **Task 21:** Add macOS Target and Platform Adaptation
7. **Task 22:** Adapt UI for Desktop (Menus, Windows, Keyboard Shortcuts)
8. **Task 23:** Test Cross-Platform Core Data Sync

#### **Phase 3: Revolutionary Features** üöÄ (Cross-Platform)
9. **Tasks 13-20:** Build revolutionary features on both platforms

#### **Phase 4: Additional Features** üîß (Cross-Platform)
10. **Task 5:** Smart Organization and Filtering
11. **Task 7:** Wiki-Style Linking System
12. **Task 8:** Advanced Tag System
13. **Task 9:** Universal Search
14. **Task 10:** Firestore Sync
15. **Task 11:** Lightning-Fast Note Creation
16. **Task 12:** Performance Optimization

### **Why This Order Makes Sense:**
- **Foundation First:** Core Data models and design system must be established before any UI work
- **Editor Before List:** You need the ability to create/edit notes before you can display them in a list
- **List Before Features:** Revolutionary features (13-20) build upon the notes list infrastructure
- **Enhancement Last:** Additional features enhance the core functionality once it's working

### **Major Task Categories:**
1. **Foundation (Tasks 1-3):** ‚úÖ Complete - iOS app setup, design system, and data layer
2. **Core Features (Tasks 4, 6):** Rich text editor and notes management (in correct order)
3. **üñ•Ô∏è macOS Foundation (Tasks 21-23):** Cross-platform extension and desktop adaptation
4. **Revolutionary UI (Tasks 13-20):** Advanced features built on both platforms
5. **Enhancement Features (Tasks 5, 7-12):** Additional functionality and optimization

## üîç **Important Notes for AI Assistants**

### **Before Starting Work:**
1. **Review Design System:** Native iOS styling guidelines
2. **Check Core Data Models:** Data persistence architecture
3. **Understand SwiftUI Components:** View hierarchy and navigation
4. **Consult Taskmaster:** `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` for current status
5. **Review Session Handoff:** For immediate context and next steps

### **Key Constraints:**
- **iOS-first** approach with macOS extension planned
- **Offline-first** architecture with Core Data
- **Performance targets** are non-negotiable
- **Privacy-focused** with local AI processing
- **iOS design compliance** is mandatory, with macOS adaptation following

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Performance:** Meet all sub-16ms and 60fps targets
- **Quality:** Comprehensive error handling and accessibility
- **User Experience:** Minimal, elegant, and iOS-optimized
- **Architecture:** Scalable, maintainable, and offline-capable

---

**Remember:** This project aims to create a revolutionary notes app that combines the best of Notion, Apple Notes, and Pinterest with native iOS excellence, then extends to macOS for cross-platform productivity. Focus on performance, offline capabilities, and the minimal, elegant design aesthetic. The SwiftUI foundation provides optimal performance and user experience across Apple platforms.

For detailed task status and progress tracking, consult the Taskmaster system in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`.

**Note:** All previous React Native progress has been abandoned. We're building from scratch with SwiftUI for optimal iOS performance and user experience.

## üñ•Ô∏è **macOS Development Strategy**

### **Why macOS After iOS?**
- **Foundation First:** Complete iOS foundation before adding complexity
- **Code Reuse:** 90%+ of code (Core Data, business logic, design system) works on both
- **User Validation:** Test core functionality on mobile before expanding to desktop
- **Natural Extension:** SwiftUI makes cross-platform development straightforward

### **macOS Development Approach**
- **Add macOS target** to existing iOS project (not separate project)
- **Adapt UI layer** for desktop (menus, windows, keyboard shortcuts)
- **Maintain shared codebase** for business logic and data models
- **Platform-specific UI** where beneficial (sidebar navigation, multi-window support)

### **Cross-Platform Benefits**
- **Larger user base** (iOS + macOS users)
- **Seamless sync** between devices via Firebase Firestore
- **Familiar interface** on each platform
- **Shared data** across all Apple devices

### **Development Timeline**
- **Week 1-4:** iOS foundation and core features
- **Week 5-6:** Add macOS target and platform adaptation
- **Week 7+:** Build revolutionary features on both platforms
