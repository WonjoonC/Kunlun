# Session Handoff - Kunlun SwiftUI Project

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW - READ FIRST**

**Kunlun** is a revolutionary notes app that combines Notion-level quality with mobile-first excellence, built entirely in SwiftUI for iOS 18+.

**What We're Building:**
- **Professional Rich Text Editor** with sub-16ms performance using native iOS capabilities
- **Pinterest-style Masonry Layout** for visual note organization  
- **Local AI Intelligence** using native iOS frameworks for privacy
- **Offline-first Architecture** with Core Data and Firebase Firestore sync
- **iOS-first Design** with native SwiftUI implementation

**Key Architecture:**
- **Framework:** SwiftUI with iOS 18.0+ deployment target
- **Database:** Core Data with Firebase Firestore for offline-first architecture
- **Design:** Mountain Serenity aesthetic with iOS semantic colors
- **Performance:** Sub-16ms keystroke response, 60fps animations
- **Platform:** iOS-first, with macOS extension planned later

## 🔄 **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW PROTOCOL - STREAMLINED**

**For Each Subtask:**
1. **Implement the subtask** completely
2. **Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md** with progress and implementation details
3. **🚨 STOP** - Do not proceed further
4. **Test the implementation** thoroughly to verify it works correctly
   - Run the project/build to ensure no compilation errors
   - Test the specific functionality implemented in the subtask
   - Verify the implementation meets the requirements
   - If issues are found, fix them and repeat testing
5. **Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md** with test results and verification status
6. **🚨 STOP** - Do not proceed further
7. **Once everything is fully tested and verified and working:**
   - **Update Taskmaster** to mark subtask as complete using `tm set-status --id=<id> --status=done`
   - **Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md** with completion status
8. **🚨 STOP** - Wait for explicit command to continue
9. **Only proceed to next subtask** when explicitly told to do so

**This ensures:**
- **Clear implementation → documentation → testing → verification flow**
- **Multiple verification points** with stops between each phase
- **Complete testing** before marking as complete
- **No rushed implementations** or skipped verification steps
- **Explicit permission** required to continue to next subtask

**For Each Main Task:**
1. **Complete all subtasks** within the main task
2. **Verify main task is 100% complete** in Taskmaster
3. **Commit all changes to GitHub** with comprehensive commit message
4. **Move to next main task** only after successful commit

**Testing Requirements for Each Subtask:**
- **Compilation Test:** Ensure the project builds without errors
- **Functionality Test:** Verify the specific feature/implementation works as expected
- **Integration Test:** Ensure the new code integrates properly with existing components
- **Documentation Update:** Update SESSION_HANDOFF.md with testing results and any issues found
- **Issue Resolution:** Fix any problems discovered during testing before marking subtask as complete

**Git Commit Requirements:**
- **Only commit after completing main tasks** (not sub-tasks)
- **Include comprehensive commit message** describing all work completed
- **Reference task numbers** in commit message
- **Ensure all files are properly staged** before committing

## 🚀 **Project Status Update**

**Date:** Current Session  
**Platform:** SwiftUI for iOS (Native)  

### **✅ COMPLETED TASKS:**
- **Task 1:** SwiftData + Firestore integration working (create/edit/delete + per-save sync)
- **Task 2:** Three-color design system fully implemented with reusable components and dark mode support
- **Task 3:** Core Data Models with Relationships - **COMPLETED** ✅
  - ✅ Subtask 3.1: Create Note Entity with Properties and Computed Values - VERIFIED & TESTED
  - ✅ Subtask 3.2: Implement NoteLink Entity with Bidirectional Relationships - VERIFIED & TESTED  
  - ✅ Subtask 3.3: Build Tag Entity with Usage Tracking - VERIFIED & TESTED
  - ✅ Subtask 3.4: Configure Relationship Rules and Cascade Delete Behavior - VERIFIED & TESTED
  - ✅ Subtask 3.5: Ensure Firestore Compatibility and Sync Validation - VERIFIED & TESTED

### **⏱️ PENDING TASKS:**
- **Task 4:** UI polish & tag management
- **Task 10:** Manual full sync (links) - deferred

**Workflow Protocol:** ✅ Following established protocol - updating both SESSION_HANDOFF.md and Taskmaster after each subtask  

## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**
- MVVM with `ObservableObject` for state
- SwiftData `@Model` entities as single source of truth
- Firestore sync via `SyncManager` and `FirestoreIntegration`
- Navigation via `NavigationStack` and `TabView`

## 🧰 **Tech Stack**
- SwiftUI (iOS 18.0+)
- SwiftData (iOS 18+)
- Firebase Firestore
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 5.9+
